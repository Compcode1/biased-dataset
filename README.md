Dataset Bias Introduction and Metrics:

Initial Baseline Metrics (Before Bias Introduction):
Total Average Exam Score: 61.85
Average Exam Score for Males: 61.40
Average Exam Score for Females: 62.31
Adjusted Bias Introduction:

We introduced a 12% reduction in Exam Scores for 50% of females over age 65 and a 10% reduction in Exam Scores for 50% of all females.
After introducing this bias, the metrics changed to:
Total Average Exam Score: 59.91
Average Exam Score for Males: 61.40 (unchanged)
Average Exam Score for Females: 58.41
Percentage Deviations (Before vs. After Bias):

Total Average Exam Score dropped from 61.85 to 59.91:
Deviation: 
3.14%
Average Exam Score for Females dropped from 62.31 to 58.41:
Deviation: 
6.26%

Discussion of ML Capabilities and Strategies to Work with This Bias:
Machine Learning Model's Ability to Detect Bias:
A machine learning model, when trained on this dataset, might detect some patterns related to gender, particularly if gender is included as a feature. Since the bias introduced is a systematic reduction in exam scores for certain subgroups of females, the model may inadvertently learn these biased patterns, leading to unfair predictions.

However, models by default are not designed to detect bias unless specific fairness techniques are applied. Instead, they will optimize for accuracy, potentially leading to biased predictions for female candidates, especially older ones.

Potential Strategies to Address and Work with Bias:

Fairness-Aware Algorithms:

Demographic Parity and Equality of Opportunity can be evaluated using fairness-aware machine learning models.
These metrics help measure if the model is disproportionately biased against certain groups (like females in this case).
Post-processing methods such as adversarial debiasing or reweighting can be applied to mitigate these effects.
Data Rebalancing or Reweighting:

You can reweight the dataset to give more importance to the underrepresented or biased group (e.g., females who have been disadvantaged by the bias).
Another approach is to oversample the affected female data points to balance the model's exposure to them.
Pre-processing Mitigation:

Fair representations could be applied to the dataset, transforming the features in a way that removes bias before training the model.
Rewriting exam scores for fairness, such as correcting for bias in females' scores using statistical methods, would be another pre-processing strategy.

Post-processing Mitigation:
After the model has made predictions, you can apply threshold adjustments or correction algorithms to ensure that bias does not disproportionately affect the output.
This could include adjusting the decision threshold to ensure that females and males are treated equally by the model.

Fairness Constraints:
Introduce fairness constraints directly into the machine learning optimization process, which penalizes the model for biased decisions and encourages equal treatment across groups.

Conclusion:
The bias we introduced is measurable and affects the average exam scores for females, particularly older females. Machine learning models trained on this data will likely pick up on these biased patterns unless steps are taken to mitigate them. Using fairness metrics, data rebalancing, or post-processing fairness techniques, we can train a model to either detect or correct this bias.
